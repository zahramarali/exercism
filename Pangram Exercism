   //Instructions Your task is to figure out if a sentence is a pangram. A
      pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. It
      is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g.
      k) or upper-case (e.g. K). For this exercise, a sentence is a pangram if
      it contains each of the 26 letters in the English alphabet.//

export const isPangram = (sentence) => {
  sentence = sentence.toLowerCase();
  const letters = new Set();
  for (let lett of sentence) {
    if (lett >= 'a' && lett <= 'z') {
      letters.add(lett)
    }
    
  }
  return letters.size === 26;
  
};
